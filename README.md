# Island Expeditions Weekly

Tired of always having to return to that table to check your progress? So was I and that's why I made this little addon.
As soon as you log in with a character or collect azerite in an island your progress will be fetched and saved.

The addon will also track your weekly world quest completion for winning an island expedition for character between levels 110 and 119.
 
## Usage

Show the progress of all your characters (levels 110+) in chat via command:

    /iew show

 Reset the database incase of errors due to changed datastructures (afterwards you will  have to log into each character again so the addon can fetch their progress)

    /iew reset
